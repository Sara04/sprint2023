## What & Why

By providing new techniques and new ways of looking at complex datasets, machine learning is currently revolutionizing many scientific fields.

The present coding sprint aims at gathering data-scientists who specialize in high dimensional time series.

Our specific goal is to integrate the classic continuous signal processing techniques and the main machine learning techniques within a common framework following [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)'s API such that user can for example do

```python
make_pipeline(
    TimeFrequencyTransform(frequencies=range(1, 100)),
    GrangerCausality(),
    SVM(kernel='rbf')
)
```

We are currently biased towards neural time series (EEG, MEG, ECoG, multi-unit neural recordings etc), but would like to bridge towards other communities which deal with signals with similar underlying structures (music, speech, radar etc).
